# IBDB
Bilkent University CS102 Term Project

This windows program was coded using Java. This was our CS102 Project. This program, “Internet Book Date Base” or shortly “IBDB” helps users to find a massive number of books from the local database that was implemented by another project member Serdar Erkal. By using this program users can see short summaries, newest books and other book categories such as science-fiction, child. Moreover, they can buy books from Amazon by pressing "Buy" button which directs the users to the book's page on Amazon.

For anything, please directly connect with me. It will be a pleasure to help you!
